But it will\r\nnot prevent you from doing silly things like uninstalling core\r\npackages that are vital to your OS X system and applications.\r\n\r\nThis is inherent to OS X Packages. Thus, you are strongly advised to\r\nmake a backup copy of your system prior to using `pkg-uninstall`. Go\r\nand setup [Time Machine](https://support.apple.com/HT201250) for that.\r\n\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nGeneral usage form is:\r\n\r\n    pkg-uninstall [options] <package-id> ...\r\n\r\nWhere package identifiers are to be found in the list of installed\r\npackages, as returned by `pkgutil --pkgs`.\r\n\r\nSo you should first make a backup copy of your system. Then, you\r\nshould dry run `pkg-uninstall` with standard user privileges and the\r\n`--dry-run` option:\r\n\r\n    pkg-uninstall --dry-run <package-id>\r\n\r\nWith this, you'll see what would happen, without actually changing\r\nanything to the system.\r\n\r\nOnce you're really sure of what you're doing, you might finally run:\r\n\r\n    sudo pkg-uninstall <package-id>\r\n\r\n\r\n### Options\r\n\r\nSeveral options can be specified.\r\n\r\n* `--help`: display usage informationdisplay usage information.\r\n\r\n* `--version`: display version number.\r\n\r\n* `--dry-run` (highly recommended for a first use): Explain what would\r\n  happen during the uninstallation, without actually modifying the\r\n  system. When running the tool with this option, you don't need\r\n  superuser privileges.\r\n\r\n* `--verbose`: be verbose about directories and files that are listed\r\n  as part of the installed package, but that cannot be actually found\r\n  in the file system.\r\n\r\n* `--force`: force uninstallation, even if some directories or some\r\n  files are actually missing on the file system. This just bypasses\r\n  safeguards that have the tool stop early in the process. It does not\r\n  enforce any operations that are prevented by `--dry-run`.\r\n\r\n* `--prefix-dir`: specify one single installation prefix directory for\r\n  all packages to uninstall, instead of fetching their individual\r\n  `InstallPrefixPath` values that are stored in the receipts\r\n  database. Package directories and files will have this directory\r\n  prepended before tring to remove them from the file system. Both\r\n  `--prefix-dir=<dir>` and `--prefix-dir <dir>` syntaxes are\r\n  supported.\r\n\r\n* `--infer-prefix-dir`: for each package to uninstall, do not use the\r\n  `InstallPrefixPath` value, but infer a suitable directory\r\n  instead. This might take a long time to run. See below for more\r\n  details.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Safeguards\r\n\r\n* Check that all specified packages are listed as installed before\r\n  proceeding. Stop with failure message if one of them is not.\r\n\r\n* Check that the directories and files (that are listed as part of the\r\n  packages) are actually present on the file system, taking any\r\n  installation prefix directory into account. Report any issue about\r\n  that (with details when `--verbose`). Advise the user to `--force`\r\n  uninstallation to proceed any further.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Caveats\r\n\r\n`pkg-uninstall` supports files and directories that include blanks\r\nlike spaces and tabs. But it does *not* supports new line (LF) and\r\ndouble quotes (\") charaters in filenames. If you run into such\r\nsituation, then a rewrite in Perl (or any similar language) will be\r\nnecessary to obtain the required robustness.\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\n`pkg-uninstall` is released under [the MIT License](LICENSE.txt).\r\n\r\n[BATS]: https://github.com/sstephenson/bats\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n# Local Variables:\r\n# indent-tabs-mode: nil\r\n# End:\r\n-->\r\n","google":"UA-68445280-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
